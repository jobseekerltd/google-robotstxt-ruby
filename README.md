# Google Robotstxt Parser C++ Library Wrapper Gem

This is a unofficial Ruby gem that provides a wrapper around [Google Robotstxt Parser C++ library](https://github.com/google/robotstxt).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```
gem 'google_robotstxt_parser'
```

And then execute:
```
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```
gem install google_robotstxt_parser
```

## Usage
At the time there is only one method available which is demonstrated below:
```
require './robotstxt'
include Robotstxt

robotstxt_content = "# robotstxt.org/\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /\n\nSitemap: https://www.bqst.fr/sitemap.xml"
user_agent = "GoogleBot"
url = "https://www.bqst.fr"

Robotstxt.allowed_by_robots(robotstxt_content, user_agent, url)
```

## Todo
There are quite a few outstanding tasks:
- [ ] Try to link the robots.dylib library from c-build instead of creating a symbolic link to /usr/local/lib/ to make it compatible with different OS
- [ ] Some tests :-)
